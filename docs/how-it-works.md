# How it Works?

## Introduction

Docker compose executor allows you to run a pod of docker containers using docker-compose.
The goal is to make sure all docker network and storage plugins work out of the box.

Running multiple pods on the same host may create many conflicts (containerId's , ports etc.). Executor takes care of resolving these conflicts.

Docker Compose isn't flexible with restart polocies for the whole pod. Executor honors restart policies of each independent container and destroy's the pod if it finds a violation. Goal is to allow developers to plugin their own version of pod monitor.

## What exactly is done ?

We use mesos labels(fileName) to read the location of docker-compose file.

We generate a new docker-compose file resolving all the conflicts

We tag each container with specific taskId and executorId and use this information to clean up containers.

The pod is monitored at a configurable interval and will be destroyed if restart policy of any  container is voilated.

We leverage mesos hooks to make sure containers are cleaned if executor is terminated.
